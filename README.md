# Extension of the code for "Perfect Competition in Markets with Adverse Selection" by Eduardo Azevedo and Daniel Gottlieb.

Generates in MATLAB the case of a monopolist in the economy setting of the paper. 


The scripts are divided in five folders:

## `./classes`

Contains classes with the most important functions.

- `model.m`: abstract class that defines all properties and methods that should be implemented by a model of perfect competition with adverse selection.
	- `healthcaralognormalmodel.m`: subclass for the health insurance model in the paper with linear contracts and normally distributed losses.
	- `healthcaralognormalmodel_nl`: subclass for the health insurance model in the paper with nonlinear contracts and lognormally distributed losses.
- `population.m`: A population object describes the preferences of a finite number of consumers. This class has methods for finding competitive equilibria and optima.

## `./figuresManuscriptCompetition`

Generates figures and tables for the linear contracts health insurance model in the paper.

- `run_directory.sh`: bash script used to run the whole folder.
- `calculations_parallel.m`: creates the populations and runs the main calculations in parallel
- `welfare_table.m`: prints the `.tex` tables used in the paper
- `plot_figures.m`: plots the figures. Uses `plotFunctions/plotEquilibriumAndOptimum.m` as an auxiliary function for some figures.

## `./figuresNonLinearModel`

Generates figures and tables for the nonlinear contracts health insurance model in the paper.

- `run_directory.sh`: bash script used to run the whole folder.
- `create_population_lognormal.m`: creates the populations in parallel. Do not forget to set the desired number of workers, this program is very CPU intensive and may take a few days if running with few cores.
- `calculate_equilibrium_parallel.m`: runs the main calculations.
- `prepare_figures.m`: saves the data used for the plots.
- `plot_figures.m`: plots the figures.
- `print*` - print tex tables and values, and some `.txt` tables with additional information.

## `./tests`

Test scripts and a folder containing exploratory analyses.

## `./plotFunctions`

Auxiliary functions for plotting:

- `num2bank.m`: Downloaded from MATLAB central and slightly modified function for formatting numbers.
- `./export_fig`: http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig

## Running

Tested in a linux server, MATLAB 2014b with a parallel cluster set up. Some of the code uses KNITRO 9.1.0. If KNITRO is not installed it will probably run correctly using MATLAB's optimization functions.
